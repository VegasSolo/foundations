Welcome to Payday! This is a game where you try to earn more money in a month than the other player. Each user will decide to roll the dice or pass their turn. The player will then move across the board. Certain events happen on the board when a player land on the corresponding letter. Once a player reaches the end of the month, their game is over.

Would you like to randomize the game board?
