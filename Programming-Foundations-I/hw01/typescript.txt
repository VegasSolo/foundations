********************************************

********** Welcome to Battleship! **********

********************************************



This is a two-player game that prints out two 

10x10 boards. Please set your terminal to at 

least 24 height to see one full board. Thanks.



********************************************

We will first place both player's ships.

The ships will be placed at a starting location 

and from there, they will always go down or to the right.

Player 1, are you ready to begin? y



Player 1, please enter the ship you would like to place: 

Enter D for [D]estroyer (size 2), r for C[r]uiser (size 3), 

S for [S]ubmarine (size 3), B for [B]attleship (size 4), 

and C for [C]arrier (size 5):
